# Project Work

My project is about passwords. In the project folder there is "10-million-password-list-top" folder which consist of top 100, 1.000, 10.000, 100.000 and 1.000.000 password lists.

## Objectives of a program:

 - [Search] Program must allow searching for any given password in the 100,000 password list and return if the given password is in the list or not. 
 - [Sort] Find an appropriate sorting algorithm and sort the 10.000 password list ascending and descending order. Show top 10 elements in both order.
 - [Hash] Insert 1.000 password list in to hash table with appropriate hash function. It would be better if the number of collusion does not exceed 200. Search a password within 1.000 password list using Hash Table and report collusion count for that search.
 - [LinkedList] Create a linked list (singly, doubly or circular it's up to you.) from 1.000 password list. According to password lenght and difference of every character, give every password a score(it's up to you!) and store these scores in the same linked list. Your node structure must contain score for every node. Sort the list according to the password strenght and output top 10 strongest and top 10 most weakest passwords.
